# Contributor Assistance

Welcome to the Eclipse IDE contributor community!
This [Eclipse-IDE](https://github.com/eclipse-ide/) organization helps you to get started and our goal is to make your contribution experience as smooth as possible.
If youâ€™re facing issues with the setup or need guidance on your initial contributions, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!

### How to reach us

- <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/assets/1f64f-25af8353fbea.png" alt="Q&A Icon" width="20" /> **Start a discussion** in our **[Q&A discussions](https://github.com/eclipse-ide/contributing/discussions/categories/q-a)**.
This way, your questions and solutions remain visible for others and helps them as well.
Our mentors and experienced contributors are there to help!

- Create an [contributing/issue](https://github.com/eclipse-ide/contributing/issues), if you have problems with the contribution documentation or encounter a mistake.

### ðŸ’¬ Questions about contributions?

Technical problems respectivly their solutions are best discussed at a corresponding Github _issue_, _discussion_ or _pull-request_ of the affected project.
See the [Project Discovery Guide](projects.md) to find it.

If you don't get answers for your questions using the channels listed above, you have a couple of options to chat directly with Eclipse IDE developers:

- <img src="https://element.io/images/favicon.png" alt="Element Icon" width="20" /> **Eclipse Foundation Chat** - If you'd like to connect with the community in real-time, join our chat rooms:
  - **[Eclipse IDE General](https://chat.eclipse.org/#/room/#eclipse-ide-general:matrix.eclipse.org)** - For everything related to the Eclipse IDE.
  - **[Eclipse IDE Newcomers](https://chat.eclipse.org/#/room/#eclipse-ide-newcomers:matrix.eclipse.org)** - Especially for new contributors looking for guidance and advice.

The chat provides a real-time experience but is less visible long-term, so we recommend starting with GitHub Discussions for questions that could help other contributors.
